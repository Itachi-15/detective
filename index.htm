            <br>An <span>bald</span> man with one eye, Bourbon described him as an impatient man. <br> <br>
            Some say he has a <span>feminine apearance</span>, and other say he is <span>One-eyed</span>, and other say is <span>huge</span> and he named 
            himself a <span>silly name</span>, but 
            according to Gin's word these characteristics are <span>wrong</span> and all of them were ivented by Rum himself 
            (ecxept that he is One-eyed) to draw <span>attentions away</span> from him. <br><br>
            This is what really appeared in the <span>Movi:26</span> and the <span>Eposide (1079)</span>. <br><br>
            In this eposide Rum appeared as he going (with disguise) to <span>cafe</span> under the investigation office of 
            detective Mori. <br> <br>
            He has very <span>strong memory</span>, he remembers that <span>Akemi</span> (Sherry's sister)
            in the second division of Titan Elementary School. <br><br>
            His favorite members are <span>Curaçao</span> and <span>Pinga</span> (they are dead right now), in which 
            Pinga was his <span>left arm</span> after Curacao's death

            Yusaku was smart too, he knew that the Organization doubts him. <br> <br>
            Rum ordered Korn to kill Akai and Kamail, and sent thier <span>pictures</span>. <br><br>
